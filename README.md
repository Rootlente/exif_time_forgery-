Title: Python script to get file times

Description: This Python script provides a function to retrieve the modification time, access time, and inode change time of a file in nanoseconds. The script uses the os module to obtain the file stats, and then converts the time values to nanoseconds. The script also includes an example usage that demonstrates how to call the function and print the file times.

Usage: To use this script, pass the file path as a command-line argument. For example:

python get_file_times.py /path/to/myfile.txt
